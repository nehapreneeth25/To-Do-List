# To-Do-List
A to-do list is an effective tool for task organization and time management. Implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it demonstrates how these technologies combine to create interactive web applications. HTML provides the structure, defining input fields, buttons, and task containers. CSS styles the interface with features like gradient backgrounds, custom fonts, and button designs, enhancing visual appeal. JavaScript enables functionality, allowing users to add, delete, or mark tasks as completed by interacting with the interface. Together, these technologies create a dynamic and user-friendly to-do list for efficient task management.
